# BootUnlock
A helper script that unlocks macOS'es encrypted APFS volumes before login

To build an macOS package you can either use "make" (if you have Xcode
installed) or just run "build/build.sh" (if you do not want to install Xcode).
The result will be the same: a package is going to be created in the "out"
directory.

To install the package just open it in Finder and follow the installation prompts.
